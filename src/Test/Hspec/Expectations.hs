-- ** Combinators for defining value-based selectors
-- |
-- Some exceptions (most prominently `ErrorCall`) have no `Eq` instance.
-- Selecting a specific value would require pattern matching.
--
-- For such exceptions, combinators that construct selectors are provided.
-- Each combinator corresponds to a constructor; it takes the same arguments,
-- and has the same name (but starting with a lower-case letter).
